## Analysis of darkweb hacking forums' trends and narratives using LDA mallet, TF-IDF, wordcloud and slangs analysis.
In the scope of an internship in CTI, the data of 9 different hacking forums were gathered with Cybersixgill and analysed. The analysis allowed to grasp the fast changing trends discussed in the context of the pandemic in order to produce intelligence. 

The code was written on google collab. The LDA model was created using mallet 2.0.8 and the gensim wrapper.  
Visualization of data uses matplotlib, pyLDAvis, pandas and WordCloud.  
The preprocessing and NLP algorithms use nltk, spacy and gensim packages.

## Analysis of Conti Group logs narratives using LDA mallet, TF-IDF, wordcloud analysis.
In the scope of the Stratosphere International Cybercrime Research Summer Award 2022, the Conti group logs were analysed to get a grasp of the roles and their distribution amongst the members of Conti. 

The code was written on google collab. The LDA model was created using mallet 2.0.8 and the gensim wrapper.  
Visualization of data uses matplotlib, pyLDAvis, pandas and WordCloud.  
The preprocessing and NLP algorithms use nltk, spacy and gensim packages. 

The data used can be found here : https://github.com/TheParmak/conti-leaks-englished/tree/master/english_chats/deepl_translated_jabber
